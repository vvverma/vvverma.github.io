## Modes in 16X2 LCD

LCD operates in two modes, which are as follows

1) *4-bit mode*

    4-bit mode is used to save GPIO Interfacing pins on the host side controller. 
    Drawback for 4-bit mode is slow data or command transfer to the LCD controller.
    In order to sent 1byte data it takes double time than 8-bit mode

2) *8-bit mode*

    8-bit mode is used to for faster GPIO data/commad transfer. 
    Drawback for 8-bit mode is more number of GPIO pins are needed.

## Types of Memory in LCD

1) *Display Data RAM (DDRAM)*

    DDRAM is used to display character on the LCD. It decodes instruction or command from IR of the LCD Controller

2) *Character Generator ROM (CGROM)*

    CGROM is responsible to convert ASCII character Hex to 5x7 or 5x8 dot matrix pattern. It has all pre-programmed supported character in the CGROM.

3) *Character Generator RAM (CGRAM)*
    CGRAM is used if we want a customized font the LCD Display. We just have to load the array to the CGRAM address.
